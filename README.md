# README

I don't know how you got here, but I doubt you'll find anything useful to you here.

This is a website that I hacked together for my ski club, in order to ease selling stuff between members.

The code is not really meant to be any of the following :
  - Clean and following best practices
  - Properly covered by tests
  - Meant to be reusable by anyone else
  - Easily translatable
  - Easily readable / extendable

Feel however free to use it !
